'''Canada''' ({{IPA-fr|kanadɑ|lang}}) is a country located in the northern part of [[North America]]. Its [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]] extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering {{convert|9.98|e6km2|e6sqmi|2|abbr=off}}, making it the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|second-largest country by total area]]. Canada's southern [[Canada–United States border|border with the United States]] is the world's longest bi-national land border. Its capital is [[Ottawa]], and its three [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|largest metropolitan areas]] are [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], and [[Vancouver]]. As a whole, Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land area being dominated by forest and tundra. Consequently, its population is highly [[urbanization|urbanized]], with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities, many near the southern border. [[Temperature in Canada|Canada's climate]] varies widely across its vast area, ranging from [[Climate of the Arctic|arctic weather]] in the north, to hot summers in the southern regions, with four distinct seasons.

Various [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|indigenous peoples]] have inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years prior to European colonization. Beginning in the16th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expeditions explored, and later settled, along the Atlantic coast.  As a consequence of [[Military history of Canada|various armed conflicts]] France ceded nearly all of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada was formed as a [[federalism|federal]] [[British Dominions|dominion]] of four provinces. This began an [[Territorial evolution of Canada|accretion of provinces and territories]] and a process of increasing autonomy from the [[United Kingdom]]. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] of 1931 and culminated in the [[Canada Act 1982|Canada Act]] of 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]], except for the power to amend [[Constitution of Canada|its constitution]].

The [[sovereign state]] of Canada is a [[federation|federal]] [[parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]], with Queen [[Elizabeth II]] being the [[head of state]]. The country is a [[Commonwealth realm|realm]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]] and [[Official bilingualism in Canada|officially bilingual]] at the federal level. It [[International rankings of Canada|ranks among the highest]] in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multicultural]] nations, the product of [[Immigration to Canada|large-scale immigration]] from many other countries. Canada's [[Canada–United States relations|long and complex relationship]] with the United States has had a significant impact on its [[Economy of Canada|economy]] and [[Culture of Canada|culture]]. 

Canada is a [[developed country]] and has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|fifteenth-highest]] nominal per capita income globally as well as the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|tenth-highest]] ranking in the [[Human Development Index]]. Its advanced economy is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|tenth-largest in the world]], relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the [[United Nations]], the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], the [[Group of Seven|G7]] (formerly [[Group of Eight|G8]]), the [[Group of Ten (economics)|Group of Ten]], the [[G20]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum.

Canada is a federation composed of ten provinces and three [[territory (administrative division)|territories]]. In turn, these may be grouped into [[List of regions of Canada|four main regions]]: [[Western Canada]], [[Central Canada]], [[Atlantic Canada]], and [[Northern Canada]] (''Eastern Canada'' refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as [[Health care in Canada|health care]], [[Education in Canada|education]], and [[Social programs in Canada|welfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=G.
