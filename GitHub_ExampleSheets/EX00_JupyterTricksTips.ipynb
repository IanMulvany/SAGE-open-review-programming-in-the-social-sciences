    "## How to add text to a Markdown cell\n",
    "A markdown cell is one that has text in it. Markdown is a simple way to add features to text, like _italics_, headers, ~~strikethrough~~, and **bold**. In a Jupyter notebook that is rendered, you can click on a cell to see the Markdown that produced the text. Some of the more common things you will see in Markdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use two tildes (the ~ character) for ~~strikethrough~~\n",
    "2. Use two asterisks (the * character) for **bold**\n",
    "3. Use underscores (the _ character) for _italics_. \n",
    "4. Lists are auto generated by having several lines, where each starts with an asterisk and a space.\n",
    " * Here is a list item\n",
    " * A second item\n",
    " * These are indented because we had a space before the asterisk\n",
    "5. You can also embed code in a Markdown cell. It won't run but it will have syntax highlighting and a monospace font. This is using three tildes and then the name of the language like so:  \n",

    "print(\"Hello World\")\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use hash (the # symbol) at the beginning of a line to make it a heading. You can use two hashes to make it a subheading (or three for subsubheading, etc...). \n",
    "7. Use the dollar symbol on either side of a formula to use math notation like $e^{{\\pi}i} = -1$ (and I use it for $commands$ ). \n",
    "8. Three or more dashes at the beginning of a line create a straight line across the page \n",

    "## How to write formulae in a cell \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this book, you will see a few formulae. For example, here is a formula for getting the average (or specifically the ''arithmetic mean'):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum^{n}_{i=1}x_{i} $$\n",

    "This formula was not written with Markdown but with a special typesetting language called $\\LaTeX$. Technical papers are often drafted in $\\LaTeX$ as are many books in STEM fields. It is less common in social sciences, but it is really handy. I wrote my dissertation (like this book) in a combination of $\\LaTeX$ and Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula was given its own line because it was enclosed with ```$$``` characters. Here is what the code looks like: ```\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum^{n}_{i=1}x_{i}```. If we enclose it with single  ```$``` it will be a formula inline, like so: $ \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum^{n}_{i=1}x_{i} $. I use inline formulae for most numbers in this book as well as commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you click on this cell, you can see the formatting underneath. Here we are just using MathJax, which is a subset of LaTeX used for formulae. StackExchange have a nice brisk tutorial of the syntax of MathJax [here](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference). Basically, there is syntax for:\n",
    "* Superscripts , ```x^i``` $e^i$, subscripts, ```x_i``` $e_i$, \n",
    "* Fractions, with ```\\frac{NUMERATOR}{DENOMINATOR}```, as in $\\frac{x^3}{y_i}$\n",
    "* Parentheses (using ```\\left(``` and ```\\right)``` to scale properly) as in $\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt x}{y^3}\\right)$\n",
    "* Summation, product, and related symbols. ```\\sum``` for $\\sum$, and ```\\prod``` for $\\prod$.\n",
    "* Greek symbols. Use their name for the symbol such as ```\\alpha``` for $\\alpha$ or ```\\omega``` for $\\omega$.\n",
    "* A host of diacritics, math symbols, and fonts. Check the tutorial above for clear examples."
